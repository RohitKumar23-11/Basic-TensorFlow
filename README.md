# Basic-TensorFlow
In this repository you can see files related to TensorFlow the first file will help you to understand the basics of TensorFlow. The Second project will help you to understand the basic regression machine learning model on insurance claim/charges. In the classification notebook I first create a model which can detect the binary difference between two circles that is it can divide the inner circles points to outer circle point. In next project in same file I used tensorflow Fashion dataset to classify 10 different cloths etc.
